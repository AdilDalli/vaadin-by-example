UsingSessionAndUIScope.shortDescription = This demo application demonstrates \
                                          the two different scopes of a Vaadin \
                                          7 session. These are the common \
                                          session scope and the new UI scope. \
                                          The UI scope represents the data \
                                          needed for the contents of one \
                                          browser window or tab opened from \
                                          the same session. This application \
                                          lets you edit one session-scoped and \
                                          one UI-scoped variable. It then \
                                          demonstrates that for each browser \
                                          window opened from the same session, \
                                          a new UI object is created that \
                                          contains its own version of the \
                                          UI-scoped variable.
